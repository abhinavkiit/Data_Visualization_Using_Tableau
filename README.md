# Data_Visualization_Using_Tableau
Project Context
This project centers on a strategic market analysis for ABG Motors, a successful Japanese automotive manufacturer. As the domestic market becomes increasingly competitive, ABG Motors aims to identify new opportunities to expand its customer base across Japan.Using a dataset of over 40,000 customer records, I developed a series of interactive Tableau dashboards to transform raw demographic and purchase data into actionable strategic insights.

Business Objectives
The primary goal was to provide ABG Motors' stakeholders with a clear visual framework to:
Identify Market Gaps: Pinpoint prefectures and cities with high growth potential but low current brand penetration.
Profile the "Ideal Customer": Segment the 40,000+ records to understand the demographic profile of high-value car buyers in Japan.
Optimize Marketing Focus: Enable data-driven decisions on where to allocate marketing spend and which vehicle models to promote in specific regions.

Strategic Insights & Impact
Enhanced Clarity: Stakeholders can now monitor performance at a granular level, moving away from static reports to a dynamic monitoring system.
Strategic Alignment: The visualization ensured immediate clarity on which market parameters are most critical to ABG Motors’ expansion goals, aiding in a more focused long-term strategy.
